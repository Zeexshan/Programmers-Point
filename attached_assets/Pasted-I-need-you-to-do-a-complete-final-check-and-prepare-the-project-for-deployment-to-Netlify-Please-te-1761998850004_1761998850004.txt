## üî¥ **CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX:**

### **1. Sidebar Disappearing on Tech Combinations Page**
**Issue:** When I navigate to Admin Panel ‚Üí Tech Combinations, the sidebar completely disappears.

**Expected:** Sidebar should remain visible on ALL admin pages, just like it does on Dashboard, Technologies, Companies, Placements, and Inquiries pages.

**Please fix and test navigation to all admin pages.**

---

### **2. Tech Combinations Page Showing No Data**
**Issue:** Tech Combinations page is empty - no combinations are displayed.

**Expected:** Should show all combinations from Google Sheet "Combinations" tab.

**Please verify:**
- Data is being fetched from Google Sheets "Combinations" tab correctly
- Data is being parsed and displayed in cards/table
- Each combination shows: Technologies, Job Role, Vacancies, Packages, Companies
- Loading state shows while fetching
- Error message shows if fetch fails
