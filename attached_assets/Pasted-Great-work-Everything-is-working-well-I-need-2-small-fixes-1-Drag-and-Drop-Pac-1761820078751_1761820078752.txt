Great work! Everything is working well. I need 2 small fixes:**

---

### **1. Drag-and-Drop Package Display - Not Working Properly**

**Current Issue:**
When I drag and drop technologies (e.g., React + Node.js + Express + MongoDB), the resulting combination doesn't show:
- ❌ Average package range
- ❌ Current vacancies
- ❌ Top hiring companies
- ❌ Job roles available

**Expected Behavior:**

When I combine:
- **React + Node.js + MongoDB** → Should show:
  ```
  🎯 MERN Stack Developer
  💰 Package: 8-15 LPA
  📊 Current Vacancies: 5000+
  🏢 Top Companies: Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, PayTM, Uber
  👔 Job Roles: Full Stack Developer, MERN Developer, JavaScript Engineer
  ```

- **Java + Spring Boot + MySQL** → Should show:
  ```
  🎯 Java Full Stack Developer
  💰 Package: 7-14 LPA
  📊 Current Vacancies: 9000+
  🏢 Top Companies: TCS, Infosys, Capgemini, HCL, Accenture
  👔 Job Roles: Java Developer, Backend Engineer, Enterprise Developer
  ```

**Please implement these pre-defined combinations:**

  }
};
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Match combinations in any order (React + Node.js = Node.js + React)
- Show result card with animated appearance
- Display all info: name, package, vacancies, companies, roles, description
- Add visual indicators (💰 for package, 📊 for vacancies, 🏢 for companies)
- Make result card larger and visually distinct from individual tech cards
- Add "Learn This Stack" button that could link to course page (for future)

---

### **2. "Start Your Journey" Button Spacing**

**Current Issue:**
The "Start Your Journey" button (or CTA button on home page) has insufficient top margin - looks cramped.

**Fix Required:**
- Add more top margin: `margin-top: 48px` (or `mt-12` in Tailwind)
- Ensure proper spacing on mobile/tablet view
- Keep consistent spacing above and below the button section

**Where to fix:**
- Home page hero section
- Any other CTA buttons that look cramped

---

### **Priority:**
1. **HIGH:** Drag-and-drop combinations showing full info
2. **MEDIUM:** Button spacing (quick CSS fix)

**Please implement these and test the drag-and-drop with at least 3 combinations to verify it works!**
