Build failed on Netlify with this error:
"updateSheet" is not exported by "client/src/utils/googleSheets.ts"
The file client/src/pages/admin/Inquiries.tsx is trying to import updateSheet function that doesn't exist.
Please fix:

Check client/src/utils/googleSheets.ts - Does it have an updateSheet function?
If NO: Either:

Option A: Add the missing updateSheet function to googleSheets.ts
Option B: Remove the import from Inquiries.tsx if it's not needed (since we're using Apps Script now)


Check client/src/pages/admin/Inquiries.tsx line 15:

typescript   import { readInquiries, updateSheet, clearCache } from "@/utils/googleSheets";
Remove updateSheet if we don't need it anymore (we're using Apps Script for writes now):
typescript   import { readInquiries, clearCache } from "@/utils/googleSheets";

Search the entire Inquiries.tsx file for any usage of updateSheet() and remove/replace it.

Since we switched to Google Apps Script for writing data, we likely don't need updateSheet anymore. Please remove it from the imports and any places it's called.
After fixing, test the build:
bashnpm run build
Make sure it completes without errors before pushing to GitHub!"

💡 About VITE_ Prefix
YES, you need VITE_ prefix for frontend variables!
How Vite Environment Variables Work:
Variable NameWhere It's UsedWhyVITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY✅ Frontend (browser)VITE_ makes it available to frontend codeVITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID✅ Frontend (browser)Can read from import.meta.env.VITE_...VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL✅ Frontend (browser)Needed for inquiry formGOOGLE_API_KEY (no VITE_)❌ Backend onlyFrontend can't access it
In your code:
typescript// This works in frontend:
const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY;

// This does NOT work (returns undefined):
const apiKey = import.meta.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY;
```

**Your current Netlify env vars are CORRECT:**
```
✅ VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY
✅ VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID  
✅ VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL
You DON'T need:

❌ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL (Apps Script handles this)
❌ SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY (Apps Script handles this)
❌ VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD (unless you added admin login - did you?)


🎯 Current Status
What's working:

✅ Apps Script URL is set
✅ Google Sheet ID is set
✅ API Key is set
✅ Build environment is correct

What's broken:

❌ Code is trying to import a function that doesn't exist
❌ Build fails before it can deploy


⚡ Quick Manual Fix (If You Can Edit Files)
If you have access to the Replit code:

Open client/src/pages/admin/Inquiries.tsx
Find line 15:

typescript   import { readInquiries, updateSheet, clearCache } from "@/utils/googleSheets";

Change to:

typescript   import { readInquiries, clearCache } from "@/utils/googleSheets";

Search for updateSheet( in the file (Ctrl+F)
Remove or comment out any lines that call updateSheet()
Save file
Test build:

bash   npm run build

Push to GitHub:

bash   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove updateSheet - using Apps Script now"
   git push

📊 What Should Happen After Fix
Once updateSheet is removed:

✅ Build will succeed
✅ Netlify will deploy
✅ Site will be live
✅ You can test if Google Sheets data loads
✅ You can test if inquiry form works with Apps Script


🎯 Environment Variables Summary
For Frontend-Only App (What You Have):
bash# Frontend can access these (VITE_ prefix required)
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1q1mo556ComV_PkDb14wmZcP6Tv__aB6Q2qCfhElmFaU
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=AQAb8RN6K983RwlQ4KAKbapVZ1
VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/...

# Optional (if you have admin login with password)
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
You DON'T need backend variables because Apps Script handles the private key!

Send that message to Replit to fix the build error, then redeploy to Netlify! 🚀
After deployment succeeds, test:

Does home page load?
Does Course Explorer show technologies?
Does Placements showcase show companies?
Does inquiry form submit? (Check Google Sheet after submitting)
