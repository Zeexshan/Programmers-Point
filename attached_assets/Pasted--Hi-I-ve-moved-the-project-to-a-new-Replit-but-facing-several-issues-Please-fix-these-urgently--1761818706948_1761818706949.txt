"Hi! I've moved the project to a new Replit but facing several issues. Please fix these urgently:**

---

### **🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:**

### **1. Database is Empty**
After importing to new Replit, I have:
- ❌ No student placement data
- ❌ No courses showing in courses section
- ❌ No companies in placement cards

**Please:**
- Create database seed script to populate initial dummy data
- Add at least 5-10 sample student placements
- Add all course categories (Frontend, Backend, Database, etc.)
- Provide instructions on how to run the seed script

---

### **2. Google Sheets Integration Not Working**
I'm not sure if Google Sheets is connected properly.

**Please verify and fix:**
- Check if service account credentials are set up correctly
- Test the connection with a dummy form submission
- Show me in admin panel: "Google Sheets: ✅ Connected" or "❌ Not Connected"
- Provide step-by-step instructions to reconnect if needed

**Environment variables I need to set:**
```
GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=?
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=?
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=?
```

Please tell me exactly where to find these values.

---

### **3. Admin Panel - How to Add Data?**

I need clear instructions on:

**A) How to add a new student placement:**
- Where is the "Add Student" button?
- What fields do I fill? (Name, Company, Package, Phone, Photo, Profile, Course, Review)
- How do I upload student photo?
- How do I assign them to a company?

**B) How to add/edit companies:**
- Where is "Add Company" button?
- Do I upload company logos?
- How to edit company details?

**C) How to add courses to the explorer:**
- How do I add "React" or "Java" to the drag-drop section?
- How do I define combinations (React + Node.js = MERN Stack)?
- Where do I set package ranges for each course?

**Please add clear buttons in admin panel for all these actions!**

---

### **4. Populate Technology Data from CSV**

I have a CSV file with current job market data (see attached). 

**Please:**
- Create an "Import CSV" feature in admin panel
- Or create a seed script that imports this data automatically
- The CSV has columns: Technology, Vacancies, Avg Package, Top Companies, Last Updated, Used For

**CSV Data Preview:**
```
Python: 950 vacancies, 6-13 LPA, Google/Amazon/Microsoft
Java: 1200 vacancies, 5-10 LPA, TCS/Accenture/HCL
React: 850 vacancies, 6-12 LPA, TCS/Infosys/Wipro
JavaScript: 1100 vacancies, 5-12 LPA, Infosys/Cognizant/IBM
... (20 technologies total)
```

**For now, please manually add at least these 5 technologies:**
1. **Python** - 950 vacancies, 6-13 LPA, Google/Amazon/Microsoft, Used for: Data Science, ML, AI
2. **Java** - 1200 vacancies, 5-10 LPA, TCS/Accenture/HCL, Used for: Enterprise Apps, Backend
3. **React** - 850 vacancies, 6-12 LPA, TCS/Infosys/Wipro, Used for: Web UI, SPAs, Frontend
4. **JavaScript** - 1100 vacancies, 5-12 LPA, Infosys/Cognizant/IBM, Used for: Frontend, Web Apps
5. **Node.js** - Add as Backend technology (use similar format)

Later I'll provide the full CSV for bulk import.

### **5. Design Issues - Header Needs Fixing**

**Current Problems:**
- Logo has no margin/padding (stuck to edge)
- Header looks too basic/empty
- No spacing between logo and other elements

**Please improve header design:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo]    Programmers Point    🏠 Home  🏆 Placements  🎓 Courses  👤 Admin
│  (proper margin on left)       (proper spacing)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Requirements:**
- Add 20-30px padding around logo
- Make header height consistent (60-70px)
- Add subtle shadow under header
- Ensure responsive on tablet (doesn't break)
- Use the blue/red theme colors

---

### **6. Admin Panel Improvements Needed**

**Add these sections to admin panel:**

**Dashboard Tab:**
- Total inquiries today/this week/this month
- Total students placed
- Pending follow-ups (students who haven't joined)
- Quick stats with nice cards

**Data Management Tab:**
- 📊 Import CSV button (for technology data)
- ➕ Add Student Placement button
- ➕ Add Company button
- ➕ Add Technology button
- ✏️ Edit/Delete options for all data

**Google Sheets Tab:**
- Connection status indicator
- Manual sync button ("Sync Now")
- View last sync time
- Export all data button

**Settings Tab:**
- Change admin password
- Configure Google Sheets ID
- Set institute details (name, logo, colors)

### **7. Sample Data to Add Immediately**

**Please seed the database with this data:**

**Companies (3 examples):**
```javascript
1. TCS
   - Logo: Use placeholder or TCS logo from web
   - Total Placements: 15
   - Avg Package: 4.5 LPA

2. Infosys
   - Logo: Use placeholder
   - Total Placements: 12
   - Avg Package: 5.2 LPA

3. Wipro
   - Logo: Use placeholder
   - Total Placements: 8
   - Avg Package: 4.8 LPA
```

**Sample Students (3 examples):**
```javascript
1. Sachin Kumar @ TCS
   - Package: 4 LPA
   - Phone: +919876543210

Database: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
Other: Data Structures, Algorithms, Git, AWS
```

**Pre-defined Combinations:**
```javascript
React + Node.js + MongoDB = MERN Stack (8-15 LPA, 500 vacancies)
Java + Spring Boot + MySQL = Java Full Stack (7-14 LPA, 900 vacancies)
Python + Django + PostgreSQL = Python Full Stack (8-16 LPA, 600 vacancies)
HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Frontend Developer (4-8 LPA, 800 vacancies)
```

### **8. Documentation Needed**

Please provide clear documentation:
- 📖 Admin panel user guide (with screenshots if possible)
- 🔧 Environment variables setup guide
- 🗄️ Database schema explanation
- 📤 How to export project for Netlify deployment
- 🔗 How to set up Google Sheets API (step-by-step)

---

### **URGENT PRIORITIES (Do These First):**
1. ✅ Fix header design (margin/spacing)
2. ✅ Seed database with sample data (3 companies, 3 students, courses)
3. ✅ Add clear "Add Student/Company/Course" buttons in admin panel
4. ✅ Test Google Sheets connection (show status in admin)
5. ✅ Import the 5 main technologies from my data (Python, Java, React, JS, Node.js)

**After these are done, I'll:**
- Test everything on tablet
- Provide full CSV for bulk import
- Deploy to Netlify
