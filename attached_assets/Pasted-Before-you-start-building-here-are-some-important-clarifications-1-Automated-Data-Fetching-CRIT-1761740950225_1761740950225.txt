Before you start building, here are some important clarifications:
1. Automated Data Fetching - CRITICAL
The app should automatically fetch and update job market data daily (vacancies, packages, trends) from:

Naukri.com
LinkedIn Jobs
Indeed
GitHub API (for technology popularity)
npm API (for JavaScript libraries)

Daily cron job at 2 AM should:

Scrape job listings for: React, Angular, Java, Python, Node.js, Django, Spring Boot, MongoDB, MySQL
Extract: Total vacancies, average package range, top hiring companies
Update database automatically
Show "Last Updated: [timestamp]" on technology cards

2. Google Sheets Auto-Sync
When a student fills the inquiry form, data should:

Save to database (PostgreSQL)
Automatically add a new row to Google Sheets (zeeexshanxkhan@gmail.com)
Create 2 sheets:

Sheet 1: All inquiries
Sheet 2: Only phone numbers of students who haven't joined (for easy copy-paste to WhatsApp)



3. Tablet Optimization - MUST HAVE

All drag-and-drop should work with touch/finger (not just mouse)
Buttons minimum 48px height for easy tapping
Disable text selection during drag
Add haptic feedback (vibration) on successful drag/drop
Test in Chrome DevTools mobile emulator (tablet view)
PWA should work offline after first load

4. Admin Panel Requirements
Password-protected admin section to:

View all inquiries in a table
Mark student as "Joined" or "Pending"
Add/edit/delete companies
Add/edit/delete student placements (with photo upload)
Manually override auto-fetched job data if incorrect
Export data to Excel (.xlsx file)
View scraper logs (to check if daily job fetch succeeded)

5. Drag-and-Drop Course Explorer
Should work exactly like Infinite Craft game:

Drag "React" from Frontend section
Drag "Node.js" from Backend section
Drop them together ‚Üí Creates new card "MERN Stack Developer"
Shows: Average package, total vacancies, job roles, top companies
Can combine 2-3 technologies (e.g., React + Node.js + MongoDB = MERN)

Pre-define these combinations:

React + Node.js + MongoDB = MERN Stack (8-15 LPA)
Java + Spring Boot + MySQL = Java Full Stack (7-14 LPA)
Python + Django + PostgreSQL = Python Full Stack (8-16 LPA)
HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Frontend Developer (4-8 LPA)

6. Placement Cards Flow

Home screen shows company cards (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc.)
Click company ‚Üí Shows all students placed in that company
Click student card ‚Üí Full details modal with:

Student photo
Name, Package, Phone (hidden by default with "Show" button)
Profile/Role (Java Developer, etc.)
Course completed at our institute
Review/testimonial
Interview rounds cleared
Study duration



7. Tech Stack Confirmation
Please use:

Frontend: React + Vite (not Create React App)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (core classes only, no custom config)
Drag-Drop: @dnd-kit/core (better for touch than react-dnd)
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL (as you mentioned)
Scraping: Puppeteer (headless browser for dynamic content)
Cron Jobs: node-cron
PWA: Workbox for offline support

8. Branding

Primary color: Blue (#1E40AF)
Secondary color: Red (#DC2626)
Institute name: "Programmers Point"
Logo: (I'll provide after you start)
Font: Inter or Poppins (modern, clean)

9. Important Notes

Phone numbers should be in format: +91XXXXXXXXXX (for easy WhatsApp export)
Date of Birth should be date picker (DD/MM/YYYY format)
Form should have validation (email format, phone 10 digits, etc.)
Success message after form submission: "Thank you! We'll contact you soon."
All timestamps should be in IST (Indian Standard Time)

10. Deployment

Frontend: Vercel
Backend: Railway.app or Render.com (free tier is fine)
Database: PostgreSQL on Railway/Render
Give me both URLs after deployment

Should I proceed with these requirements?"


ü§î Should You Start the App?
My Recommendation: YES, but...
‚úÖ Start the app IF:

You've sent the above clarifications to Replit
Replit confirms they understood all points
You're ready to provide:

Your institute logo (PNG/SVG)
2-3 real placement examples for testing
Your Google account for Sheets integration



‚ùå WAIT if:

You're still unsure about any feature
You want to add more requirements
You haven't decided on tablet model yet
